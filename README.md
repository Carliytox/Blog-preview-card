## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project, I learned how to use **clamp()** for responsive font sizes and widths without media queries. Here's an example:

```css
.title {
  font-size: clamp(20px, 23px, 28px);
  font-weight: 800;
}

I also practiced working with hover effects to improve interactivity:

.title:hover {
  color: hsl(47, 88%, 63%);
  cursor: pointer;
}

## Continued development

In future projects, I want to:

- Focus on improving accessibility by using ARIA roles and better semantic elements.
- Experiment with CSS Grid for layout designs.
- Explore tools like SASS for better CSS management.

## Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - Helped me with understanding CSS properties like `clamp()` and semantic HTML.
- [Frontend Mentor Community](https://www.frontendmentor.io/community) - A great place for asking questions and sharing knowledge.
